# The Uberon/CL Team

![](images/uberon_logo.png)

The Uberon team is responsible for managing the Uberon project. It usually comprises a number of professional ontology editors hired by various projects with an anatomy ontology component, a number of OBO volunteers and various stakeholders. Due to their closeness, the Uberon and CL ontologies are managed by the same team. See also the [GitHub contributor list](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/graphs/contributors).
