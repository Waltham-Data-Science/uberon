# Naming pattern: lower primary/secondary side tooth number

# all lower teeth reside in mandible, which is a subclass of lower jaw bone

## will need to make tooth first, separately (e.g., molar tooth 1 needs to already exist)
## in most cases, one will know if it is primary or secondary, as well as if it is upper or lower tooth.
## need to create combination of lower and primary/secondary, do know need to make them individually
# create upper and lower tooth with subclasses: 'calcareous tooth' and 'part of' some 'dentition'
# create upper secondary tooth and upper primary tooth with subclass 'upper 'tooth''
## not doing side but leaving this here in case side is included in the future
# create right and left upper inscisor with subclass 'upper incisor'
# create right and left primary and secondary upper incisor with subclass 'primary upper incisor' and 'secondary upper incisor'
